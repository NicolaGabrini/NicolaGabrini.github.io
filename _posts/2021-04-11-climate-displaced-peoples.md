You probably did not notice during Holy Week that a [document of great importance](https://bit.ly/3d6cLWr) was released by the Vatican: Pastoral Guidelines on Climate Displaced People.  While we must leave the theological interpretation of this masterwork for the theologians, it is worth noting a few things about the introduction. I admit before hand that I do not see and even online research has indicated to me that even if one wants to read about climate displaced people, this document is the place because you won't find much in the media.  But let's get to some passages from the Pope's introduction.

>I suggest we adapt Hamlet’s famous “to be or not to be” and affirm: “To see or not to see, that is the question!” Where it starts is with each one’s seeing, yes, mine and yours.

So it is admitted that we might not see the reality of climate displaced peoples, but it goes on:
>We are engulfed by news and images of whole peoples uprooted by cataclysmic changes in our climate, forced to migrate.

This is only a sign for me that I am living on a different planet, or do not have access to the Vatican internal news that reports on the global environmental crisis and the masses of migrating peoples displaced due to climate change.
>When people are driven out because their local environment has become uninhabitable...

The "when" seems important.  I ask: when are these people going to be displaced?
>For a long time the [climate crisis] developed so slowly that it remained imperceptible except to a very few clairvoyants. Even now it is uneven in its impact: climate change happens everywhere, but the greatest pain is felt by those who have contributed the least to it.
