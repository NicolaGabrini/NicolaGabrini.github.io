It is necessary to sometimes go beyond the limited scope of strictly Papal documents to understand how much the Holy See is expanding its ministry to the periferies.  There were two documents this past week published under the aegis of various dicasteries which highlight some of the most important concerns of Catholics of our times: [ramadan](https://bit.ly/3x3UelG) and [the circus](https://bit.ly/3sycjVn).

>As it is well known, the pastoral care of circus artists is among the tasks of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development.

It is good to hear these obvious truths of the faith restated with such clarity under the present Pontificate.

>For this reason I ask circus performers of all latitudes who are suffering so much during this pandemic to bring their art, as soon as possible, to the places where children and the elderly suffer.

It is time that we come to realize that what the covid situation needs is not home care protocols or OTC drugs, but vaccines and clowns. It is too much to pray for deliverance or to bring the sick the Sacraments. Rather, the carnies must go in and minister with their art, and bring...

>an explosion of pure joy, such as the one offered by the circus.

With such joy we turn to the Vatican's official document for Ramadan 1442. Yes, the Vatican was nice enough to include in primary place the year according to the Hijri calendar, which commemorates history as centering on the migration of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina rather than on the birth of Our Lord and Saviour, which is here relegated to parentheses. In this message, we have a Vatican teaching on Ramadam, which is...
>a month rich in divine blessings and spiritual advancement.

Wow, that sounds great.  But then the document turns to a sort of clerical teaching, that seems to lack a bit in a true spirit of interreligious dialogue:
>At this time, then, we think it fitting to share with you some reflections on this virtue \[of hope\].

And perhaps as Muslims, you think that you should hope in Allah, but...
>Many times, in situations of difficulty and despair, help, and the hope it brings, can come from those whom we least expect. Human fraternity, in its numerous manifestations, thus becomes a source of hope for all...

That is what Fratelli Tutti is all about. Let us not forget the paternalistic spirit that made Pope Francis visit you in Iraq. You Muslims are not on board with a new world Masonic religion the way that most Catholic bishops are.

>All these persons and their goodness remind us believers that the spirit of fraternity is universal, and that it transcends all boundaries: ethnic, religious, social and economic. ... This is why the growing care and concern for the planet, our “common home”, is, according to Pope Francis, yet another sign of hope.

See, fraternity is universal.  We do not need to kill Christians if everyone would just embrace the new religion. The first act of faith in this religion will be to correct our way of dealing with our common home (which might also provide for sharing resources with the major fraternal powers...).
