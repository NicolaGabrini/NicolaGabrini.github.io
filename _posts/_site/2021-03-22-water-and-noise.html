<p>Today we should be grateful that the Holy See wanted to remind us of the important World Day of Water. If you were expecting a response about the suspension of Masses in St Peter’s Basilica, then you failed to understand 
what is really important: water. Yes, Cardinal Parolin’s whose office published the poorly worded and unsigned or numbered memorandum changing the tradition of 1000 years, is worried about something older and much more 
endangered: water. There is a newspeak entry here, and as faithful Catholics we must submit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>En lugar de hablar de su “consumo”, debemos referirnos a su “uso” sensato…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you didn’t get that, like evil European colonializers, we have been speaking about “consuming” water.  No more, we can only speak now of “using” water.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the empty altars of St Peter’s would have been difficult to use this morning with the loud microphones of the Mass at the Altar of the Chair.  This extremely loud speaker system was necessary so that the 
4 (literally) faithful there could hear.  Apparently there were no lectors or acolytes or the female version of the same. Be patient, animation will come with time, there is the law of gradualness. But it is hard to find 
enough chasubles, so one of the 3 three priests concelabrating for the 4 faithful was obliged to make do with just a stole.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, though, the Pope gave an <a href="http://bit.ly/2Pf0Wnu">important discourse</a> to the Philippino College.  There he made clear what season we are in.  Not Lent, or Passiontide,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And today, dear friends, is the time of concreteness.  Today is concreteness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that has not clarified the situation, then there is no hope for you.</p>
