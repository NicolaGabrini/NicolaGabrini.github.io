<p>There is nothing like reading a <a href="http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/angelus/2021/documents/papa-francesco_angelus_20210321.html" target="_blank">Sunday Angelus</a> address to make one start a blog to comment on the absurdities of our present hour.  Indeed, we have a few real gems today from the Vatican as we begin Passiontide (which was thrown out because it smacked of clerical moralism).  But let’s get to the text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sign of the Cross comes to mind, which over the centuries has become the symbol par excellence of Christians. Even today, those who wish to “see Jesus”, perhaps coming from countries and cultures where Christianity is not well-known, what do they see first? What is the most common sign they encounter? The Crucifix, the Cross.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, it is clear that we are “over” Passiontide, because the crosses are all covered in the Churches today.  He is showing remarkable liberty of spirit from the past, or perhaps just sheer ignorance of other liturgical traditions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The witness of a life that is given in service…means sowing seeds of love, not with fleeting words but through concrete, simple and courageous examples, not with theoretical condemnations, but with gestures of love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great!  Service does not mean condemnation, let alone theoretical condemnation!  And so much for fleeting words, let’s get concrete!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then the Lord, with his grace, makes us bear fruit, even when the soil is dry due to misunderstandings, difficulty or persecution, or claims of legalism or clerical moralism. This is barren soil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one required consultation of the Italian, which also bears the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacoluthon">anacoluthon</a>.  It seems like he wants to criticise legalism or clerical moralism, but the sentence says that the Lord makes even these bear fruit. Indeed, too much fruit, and that fruit cannot be seen celebrating Mass in St Peter’s Basilica.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mafia are present in various parts of the world and, exploiting the pandemic, they are enriching themselves through corruption. Saint John Paul II denounced their “culture of death”…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the mafia exploiting the pandemic as such, or the lockdown?  Are you supporting the lockdowns and the pandemic newspeak?  Okay, but wasn’t John Paul speaking about the culture of death in abortion and the abortion industry?  And maybe would have objected immoral research on fetal tissue of aborted babies?</p>

<p>These mafia characters must be really reprehensible:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>These structures of sin, mafia structures, contrary to Christ’s Gospel, exchange faith with idolatry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, the idolatry of the mafia is not one of the religions willed by God as stated in the Abu Dhabi document.  It also has to be distinguished from the pachamama idolatry which, unlike the traditional Latin Mass, is welcome in the Vatican.</p>

<p>No matter, let’s get to what really counts:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Tomorrow is World Water Day, which invites us to reflect on the value of this wonderful and irreplaceable gift of God. For us believers, “sister water” is not merchandise: it is a universal symbol and is the source of life and health.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the solution to the world’s problems.  Nevermind the Feast of St Benedict today, or Lent. We need water!!</p>
