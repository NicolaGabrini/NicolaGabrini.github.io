I cannot avoid the fact that many around me, even in the traditional world, are vaccinated. If that was not already a problem, they often are not in the slightest bit ashamed, or want to enter into conversations about the liceity of taking these experimental vaccines developed through immoral research on aborted fetal cell lines. It is hardly honest to do such a thing. Maybe they are having doubts, maybe they want to convince me that they made the right choice and that they would like me to do the same. Meanwhile, their decisions have oftenbeen based more on convenience than on the real value of the vaccine or on the actual moral character of the decision (the ramblings from certain residents of Casa Santa Marta imply that taking the vaccine might even be a morally praiseworthy action).

## What are we unvaccinated to do before these?
I think that we have to we willing to tell them that their decision was mistaken. Do we have principles? Do we have good reason to doubt the efficacy and the safety of these vaccines? Should we be silent before a transgression against prudence? Should we fail to say anything in favor of the babies whose organs are still being harvested and used by such companies for various types of research? No, we should speak openly and call these people to conversion. In this, we can be more pastoral than anyone of the vaccinated camp who are trying to quiet their conscience by convincing us they did the right thing. This is why women who have had abortions fly into wild rage before pro-life activists. They are fighting the feeling of guilt and horror at what they have done. On a lesser level, so too, our friends and relatives are fighting the sense of guilt they have at betraying the pro-life movement. They have even betrayed us by submitting themselves not too science, but to the unjust impositions of unjust regimes.
