The Italians have a single word for mama's boy, given that all Italian men are such, it is mammone. Unfortunately we have a Pope who is not only not an Italian, nor a mammone, but a Pachamammone.

Let us not forget: the Pope, who is dying, and who we must pray for, allowed a pagan idol to be carried into the Vatican Basilica. He stood before this idol with his back to the Confession of St Peter. He witnessed a pagan ceremony in the Vatican gardens, during which an Amazonian witch seemed to put a curse on his anointed hands.  He then suggested himself to the master of ceremonies that a plant, offered to this demoness should be placed on the altar over the tomb of the Fisherman. Before this he signed a document at Abu Dhabi which embraces syncretism that is heretical, even though he told some that they could clarify it for themselves. And he claimed that this did not go one step beyond Vatican II. He allowed the publication of a document banning the blessings of human relationships which are contrary to nature, and then went on to look the other way while this very thing was done throughout the world. Before all this he basically condoned permitting adulterers return to communion, substituting mercy with a paternalism that cares less for the salvation of souls than it does for its own vanity.

Let us not forget. May he repent. May Our Lady, terror of the Pachamama and destroyer of heresies obtain those graces for him, lest he should burn in hell. May we be faithful to the Church and her Tradition until death, lest we should suffer the same fate. God will be faithful, and He shall save His own. May we, by the help of our Heavenly Mother, be in that number.
