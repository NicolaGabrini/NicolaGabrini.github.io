## Traditionis Custodes
Well, the absolute absurdity of the document which issued forth from the Pachamana-Papa yesterday was enough to almost make me laugh. If it weren't for the thousands of laity and priests and faithful that might be scandalized by the appearance of legality, the whole thing would have been truly laughable. Rather, we must assert, the whole thing manifests the absurdity of papal absolutism. This fruit of the modern papacy, and the corresponding ultra-montaigne papal cheerleaderism has come to an end. Even Raymond Arroyo of EWTN, a long-time strongly Pope-friendly news source, had no fear of openingly criticizing this document on the very day that it was issued. Subsequent interventions of local ordinaries are coming down on the pro and contra side, such that there will really be two sets of dioceses in the world, that of persecution, and those where the Mass will continue to be widely available.
