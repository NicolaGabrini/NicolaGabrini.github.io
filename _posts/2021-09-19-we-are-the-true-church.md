I respect the desires of the head of the religious communities to gather and to produce a document about the horrific future that they might see under the new regime of Traditionis Custodes, and I sincerely share their concerns and fears, I am still not afraid to criticise their document. It seems that it is a political statement and intended to forestall certain bad habits of the Vatican in acting in a non-synodal way with authoritarian commiseriats and documents with Papal administrative approval (which means no appeal).

But there is at least one sentence, where they got the best of themselves and said something that is, quite frankly, idiotic:
> We do not see ourselves as the “true Church” in any way.

What do they mean? I am admit that I do think of myself as the true Church, at least in the way that I am a member of it. Are they not members of the true Church? Or do they intend to distance themselves from the true pachamamian Church of Bergoglio? This was not an intelligent thing to say, and it should be retracted.

Further, the citation of *Amoris Laetitia* is disingenuous. Unlike the dubia Cardinals, they have said nothing corporately about this document and the confusion that it has caused. Pretending that it really should be a guide of the supposed dialogue with the Holy See about their continued existence is to pretend like they really accept the things that are found their. It sounds like a nice political move, but it is not what they would say in private, it's just talk...

And the Vatican does not care...
