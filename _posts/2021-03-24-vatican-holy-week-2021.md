A few comments about the [Holy Week schedule](https://bit.ly/2NSyTKo) for the Vatican:

The Vatican News says that Palm Sunday is on the 28th of APRIL.  Let's hope this is a typo and not an innovation.

The Mass of the same Sunday will be at the Altar of the Chair. This continues the disuse of the main altar of the Basilica after it had placed upon it a plant that had been offered to a pagan idol.

The Chrism Mass on Thursday morning of Holy Week, again at the altar of the Chair. The Mass of the Lord's Supper (perhaps the most sacred of the year) will be presided over by Cardinal Re.  Is the Pope just that weak nowadays?  Or does the Mass of the Institution of the Most Holy Sacrament not interest him?

The really exciting part of the news is that kids and teenagers, from 3-19 years in age, have prepared images and texts for the Stations of the Cross.  We can see that these images will certainly be in a hermeneutic of continuity with the type of artwork found in Novus Ordo books. Also we will avoid any haughty professionalism by not employing professional artists who certainly are not in need of work right now.  The best part is that we will avoid any meanful theological content by asking teenagers to guide the rest of the world in meditation on the Passion. With the current state of theology in the Vatican, perhaps this is a praiseworthy solution.
